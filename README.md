## Things done

1. Fixed the peer-to-peer dependencies (updated requirements.txt in chat_backend)
2. Trying to bring the database to cloud (integrating mongodb atlas)

        - Peer-to-peer chat system has smoothly been connected to an online database

        - The assessment thing is not saving its data in the mongodb atlas. Let's see about that.
